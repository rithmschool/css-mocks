# Assignment 5: Sunrise, sunset

Your goal in this assignment is to create a full-page, responsive animation for the rising and setting of the sun.

Like the previous assignment, this one makes use of keyframes. Positioning will likely be helpful too. Feel free to Google around a bit if you need a hand.

Also, unlike previous assignments, you'll find that some starter code has been provided to you. This code scaffolds out the structure of the HTML and adds some basic styling. Feel free to adjust the starter code if you like, but just note that this is the code used in the model solution!

Good luck!
